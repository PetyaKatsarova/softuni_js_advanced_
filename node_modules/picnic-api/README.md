# Picnic-API
Unofficial (unaffiliated) Node.js npm package for the API of the online supermarket Picnic.

## Getting started
Using `npm`:
```
npm install picnic-api
```

Then import the package into your project. `PicnicClient` is the default export. `CountryCodes` can be included when you want to make requests for the German version of Picnic for example. `ImageSizes` can be used for retreiving images. `HttpMethods` can be used when you want to make custom requests. More on that below.
```js
import PicnicClient, { CountryCodes, ImageSizes, HttpMethods } from "picnic-api";

// or

const PicnicClient = require("picnic-api");
const { CountryCodes, ImageSizes, HttpMethods } = PicnicClient;
```

Now initialize the Picnic client with an optional options object.
```js
const picnicClient = new PicnicClient();

// or

const picnicClient = new PicnicClient({
    countryCode: CountryCodes.NL, // The country code for the requests.
    apiVersion: "17", // default 17 as this is what the app currently uses. The api version for the requests. Does not seem to do anything yet.
    authKey: "long string here", // default null. The code for the x-picnic-auth header to make authenticated requests. If not supplied then login() needs to be called before making any other requests.
    url: "url here" // default https://storefront-prod.nl.picnicinternational.com/api/17. The url to send requests to.
});
```

If no authKey was given in the options use the `login` method. Empty response if successful, otherwise an error.
```js
await picnicClient.login("email", "password");
// send an authenticated request...

// or

picnicClient.login("email", "password").then(_ => {
    // send an authenticated request...
});
```

Example of a `GET` request:
```js
let searchResults = await picnicClient.search("Affligem blond");

// or

picnicClient.search("Affligem blond").then(searchResults => {
    
});
```

Example of a `POST` request:
```js
await picnicClient.addProductToShoppingCart(11295810, 2);

// or

picnicClient.addProductToShoppingCart(11295810, 2).then(shoppingCart => {
    
});
```
If you like this library then consider using my discount code [MAAR3267](https://picnic.app/nl/vriendenkorting/MAAR3267) so that we both get a 5 euro discount on our orders. ðŸ˜„

## API Routes
Most API routes have been implemented as methods in the `PicnicClient` class. However, to get a list of all known API routes the method `getKnownApiRoutes` can be used. These routes are extracted from the Picnic android app. Latest extraction done for version `1.15.77`.

Examples of a custom (unimplemented) request:
```js
picnicClient.sendRequest(HttpMethods.GET, "/unknown/route");
picnicClient.sendRequest(HttpMethods.POST, "/invite/friend", { email: "email@email.email" });
```
